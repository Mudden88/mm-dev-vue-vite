        <b>Education:</b>
        <p class="ps-3">
          I am actively expanding my skillset at IT Högskolan, where I'm immersing myself in the world of HTML,
          CSS, UX/UI design, JavaScript, React, Vue, Node.js, TypeScript, SQLite, MongoDB and CMS. The dynamic and
          comprehensive
          curriculum is shaping me into a versatile and well-rounded developer.
        </p>
        <b>Professional Background:</b>
        <p class="ps-3">
          With a solid foundation built over 15 years in the construction business, including 5 years as a
          supervisor,
          I bring a unique perspective to my development work. The attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and
          leadership experience gained in the construction industry greatly influence my approach to coding.</p>
        <b>Passion for Frontend Development:</b>
        <p class="ps-3">
          I thrive on the challenges and creative possibilities of frontend development. From the elegance of
          Vanilla
          JavaScript to the structured beauty of CSS, I enjoy every aspect of translating ideas into interactive and
          visually appealing websites.</p>

        <b>Commitment to User-Centric Design:</b>

        <p class="ps-3">

          Studying UX/UI design has heightened my commitment to creating not just visually stunning, but also
          user-friendly interfaces.
          I believe in putting the user at the center of the design process to ensure a
          seamless and enjoyable experience.
